Print Colored Text with Python
Traditionally, printing full-colour text to the terminal is accomplished by a series of escape characters on Linux or OS X systems. However, this will not work for Windows operating systems. Now letâ€™s see how to print coloured text with Python using the Colorama module:


import colorama
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style
colorama.init(autoreset=True)

print(Fore.BLUE+Back.YELLOW+"Hi My name is Aman Kharwal "+ Fore.YELLOW+ Back.BLUE+"I am your Machine Learning Instructor")
print(Back.CYAN+"Hi My name is Aman Kharwal")
print(Fore.RED + Back.GREEN+ "Hi My name is Aman Kharwal")
